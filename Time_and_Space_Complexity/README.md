# Time & Space Complexity (C++)

This folder contains beginner-friendly C++ examples
to understand different types of time and space complexity.

## ⏱ Time Complexity
- Linear Time → O(n)
- Logarithmic Time → O(log N)
- Square Root Time → O(√N)
- Quadratic Time → O(n²)
- Linearithmic Time → O(n log n)

## 💾 Space Complexity
- Variable → O(1)
- Extra array / vector → O(n)
- Matrix → O(n²)

## ✅ Status
Completed basic understanding of time and space complexity.
